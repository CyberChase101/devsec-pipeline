Heres how it works:

* The pipeline is divided into stages, each representing a specific phase in the DevSecOps process.

* The "Build" stage is responsible for building your application and running unit tests. You can add your build steps as needed.

* The "StaticCodeAnalysis" stage focuses on Static Code Analysis using SonarQube. It includes a job named "SonarQube" that runs the sonar-scanner command, which performs the analysis. Make sure to set the SONAR_TOKEN environment variable with your SonarQube access token.

* The "SoftwareCompositionAnalysis" stage performs Software Composition Analysis using OWASP Dependency-Check. The job named "DependencyCheck" downloads and runs Dependency-Check using the provided script. Adjust the script by replacing <path_to_your_project> with the path to your project.

* The "DynamicApplicationSecurityTesting" stage conducts Dynamic Application Security Testing using OWASP ZAP. The job named "OWASPZAP" downloads and runs OWASP ZAP using the provided script. Modify <your_application_url> with the URL of your application to be scanned.

* The "Deploy" stage represents the deployment phase of the pipeline. You can include steps to deploy your application using tools like Ansible
